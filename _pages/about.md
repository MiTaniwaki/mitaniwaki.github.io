Welcome! My name is **Michiki Taniwaki**. -> [Japanese version here (日本語はこちら)](/about-ja/)

I was born and raised in Osaka, Japan. I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Materials Science and Technology at Tokyo University of Science. My primary research focus lies at the intersection of multiple disciplines in physics, including machine learning (ML), topology, and condensed matter theory. You can find more details in the [Publications](/publications/) section.

Outside of research, I enjoy watching football, competitive programming, and learning languages. I played football for 12 years starting at the age of 9, and my favorite teams are Manchester United and Cerezo Osaka. I'm also passionate about programming, primarily in Python and C++, which I actively use in my research. I like sustainable activities—such as walking, working out, and learning new things. One of my greatest joys is studying science and technology, especially because so much valuable knowledge is freely accessible. ^_^

One of my important values is learning to view everything from diverse perspectives. I’ve often felt stuck when overly focusing narrowly or viewing a problem from only a single angle. I believe that broadening our perspectives helps us find more meaningful insights and creative solutions. I also value having a sense of purpose: having even a single clear goal can clarify what matters most, help us identify challenges, and guide us toward the next steps. (Of course, I also enjoy the fun of spontaneous adventures and sightseeing). Another priority for me is understanding myself. When I feel stuck or anxious, I try to observe my own thoughts and situation. I’ve found that self-awareness can be a key to moving forward.

My research takes an interdisciplinary approach. One of my strengths is integrating knowledge from various fields—such as ML and topological data analysis (TDA)—to explore physical systems from new angles. My long-term dream is to continue doing research even after retirement. That’s why I aim to understand my field deeply and from as many angles as possible. Although I expect to face challenges along the way, I’m confident I can face them with the support of my friends, mentors, and my family—who have always been my greatest source of encouragement.
