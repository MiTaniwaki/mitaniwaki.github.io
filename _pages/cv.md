**Reconstruction Activities in Response to the Great East Japan Earthquake, Dec. 2012**

I engaged in the volunteer activities of a football club that hosted elementary school students from regions impacted by the Great East Japan Earthquake. I contributed to the reconstruction efforts by coordinating football matches and arranging homestay accommodations for the students.
